scProportionTest
======================

**Single Cell Proportion Test in Python** is designed to analyze the difference between the proportion of cells in clusters between two scRNA-seq samples. A permutation test is used to calculate a p-value for each cluster, and a confidence interval for the magnitude difference is returned via bootstrapping. Results can be visualized using a point range plot. View the `tutorial <https://github.com/SamuelAMiller1/py-scProportionTest/blob/main/tutorials/scPropTest_tutorial.ipynb>`_ to get started. If you are working with an Seurat object, you may consider the `implementation in R <https://github.com/rpolicastro/scProportionTest/tree/master>`_.
